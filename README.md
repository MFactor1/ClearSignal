# ClearSignal

Making communication more accessible for those in their **greatest time of need**.

During a routine surgery, my aunt suffered a severe stroke, leaving her unable to speak or communicate effectively during the initial stages of her recovery. During a visit, I recognized an opportunity to leverage my skills to create a solution that could help her express both basic needs and complex ideas. **Within a week**, while managing my academic responsibilities, I developed ClearSignalâ€” a **redistributable** application packaged as an **executable file** (EXE) and deployed on her laptop.

ClearSignal leverages a compact keypad with three distinctively textured keys to interface with its system. These keys correspond to three customizable actions (defaulted to "Yes," "No," and "Custom") and provide access to a virtual keyboard for typing. The application offers **full customization** of colors and text through an easily editable **INI file**, ensuring adaptability to individual user preferences and needs.
