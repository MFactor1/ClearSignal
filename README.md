# ClearSignal

Making communication more accessible for those in their **greatest time of need**.

When my aunt had a severe stroke during a routine surgery, she was unable to speak or communicate during the early phases of her recovery. During a visit, I realized I could be leveraging my skills to allow her to communicate basic needs, and even complex ideas. In **under a week**, while also balancing school, I had ClearSignal up and running on their laptop as a **redistributable EXE**. ClearSignal uses a small keypad (3 keys) with each key textured differently to interact with the interface and allow the user to activate one of three buttons (default yes, no, custom) as well as type on a virtual keyboard. All the colors and text are easily and **fully customizable** by the user via the **INI file**.
